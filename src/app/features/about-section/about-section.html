  <h1>Welcome to the Journey 👋</h1>
  <p>
    I’m Moe Holder, a Computer Science major at the University of West Georgia,
    graduating in December 2026. In 2023, I made a career change from HR and
    Recruiting into tech and it’s been an exciting journey ever since. This site
    is part reflection, part resource, and built from the skills I’ve gained this summer.
