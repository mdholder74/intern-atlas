        <div class="content-green">
            <p>This summer, I had the opportunity to work with the Customer Experience product team, specifically within the <span class="highlight-blue">Customer Portal Vertical</span>. 
                This team is responsible for the Customer Portal used by homebuyers, focusing on delivering features such as service requests, resources, messaging, and home updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="highlight-blue">Customer Portal Vertical</span> is a cross-functional group made up of an <strong>IT Director, IT Senior Manager, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Analysts,  Developers, and QA professionals</strong> . 
                We collaborated closely throughout each sprint to deliver incremental improvements to the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time with the team, we focused on a major feature called <strong>two-way communication</strong>, which enhances communication between our <span class="highlight-green">Sales, Construction, and Homebuyers</span>.
                This functionality enables the Construction team to share updates align with each home's project timeline. 
                This keeps both the Construction team and the homebuyer informed and in sync on progress, key milestones, and what‚Äôs coming next in the homebuilding journey.

        <p>As my first software engineering internship, this summer was packed with learning, growth, and hands-on experience. I had the chance to contribute to real-world projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and see how code goes from concept to production.</p>

                <p>
                    This summer, I contributed to enhancing the two-way communication features on the Customer Portal website.
                    I focused on resolving bugs tied to user stories, with most of my work centered around improving functionality and refining the user experience.

                <p>
                    I also contributed to updating the technical documentation for our Dev Local Environment Setup. 
                    This documentation plays a critical role in onboarding developers, as it outlines the first steps for configuring a local development environment and gaining access to the team‚Äôs repositories essential for working on both the Customer Portal and the backend systems that power the website.
