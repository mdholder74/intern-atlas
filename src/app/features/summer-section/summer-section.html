        This summer, I had the opportunity to work with the Customer Experience
        product team, specifically within the
        <span class="highlight-purple">Customer Portal Vertical</span>. This team
        is responsible for the Customer Portal used by homebuyers, focusing on
        delivering features such as service requests, resources, messaging, and
        home updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight-purple">Customer Portal Vertical</span> is a
        cross-functional group made up of an
        <strong
          >IT Director, IT Senior Manager, Product Owner, Scrum Master,
          Analysts, Developers, and QA professionals</strong
        >
        . We collaborated closely throughout each sprint to deliver incremental
        improvements to the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time with the team, we focused on a major feature called
        <strong>two-way communication</strong>, which enhances communication
        between our
        <span class="highlight-pink">Sales, Construction, and Homebuyers</span
        >. This functionality allows homebuyers to respond directly to updates and messages from the sales or construction teams. It enables seamless two-way communication, which is essential for delivering a great customer experience and keeping everyone informed.

      As my first software engineering internship, this summer was packed with
      learning, growth, and hands-on experience. I had the chance to contribute
      to real-world projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and see
      how code goes from concept to production.

          This summer, I contributed to enhancing the two-way communication
          features on the Customer Portal website. I focused on resolving bugs
          tied to user stories, with most of my work centered around improving
          functionality and refining the user experience.

          I also contributed to updating the technical documentation for our Dev
          Local Environment Setup. This documentation plays a critical role in
          onboarding developers, as it outlines the first steps for configuring
          a local development environment and gaining access to the team‚Äôs
          repositories essential for working on both the Customer Portal and the
          backend systems that power the website.
