        This summer, I had the opportunity to work with the Customer Experience
        product team, specifically within the
        <span class="highlight-blue">Customer Portal Vertical</span>. This team
        is responsible for the Customer Portal used by homebuyers, focusing on
        delivering features such as service requests, resources, messaging, and
        home updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span class="highlight-blue">Customer Portal Vertical</span> is a
        cross-functional group made up of an
        <strong
          >IT Director, IT Senior Manager, Product Owner, Scrum Master,
          Analysts, Developers, and QA professionals</strong
        >
        . We collaborated closely throughout each sprint to deliver incremental
        improvements to the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time with the team, we focused on a major feature called
        <strong>two-way communication</strong>, which enhances communication
        between our
        <span class="highlight-green">Sales, Construction, and Homebuyers</span
        >. This functionality enables the Construction team to share updates
        align with each home's project timeline. This keeps both the
        Construction team and the homebuyer informed and in sync on progress,
        key milestones, and what‚Äôs coming next in the homebuilding journey.

      As my first software engineering internship, this summer was packed with
      learning, growth, and hands-on experience. I had the chance to contribute
      to real-world projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and see
      how code goes from concept to production.

        <h3>üîÑ Two-Way Communication</h3>
        <p>
          This summer, I contributed to enhancing the two-way communication
          features on the Customer Portal website. I focused on resolving bugs
          tied to user stories, with most of my work centered around improving
          functionality and refining the user experience.

        <h3>üìÑ Dev Enviorment Docs</h3>
        <p>
          I also contributed to updating the technical documentation for our Dev
          Local Environment Setup. This documentation plays a critical role in
          onboarding developers, as it outlines the first steps for configuring
          a local development environment and gaining access to the team‚Äôs
          repositories essential for working on both the Customer Portal and the
          backend systems that power the website.

      This summer, I had the opportunity to dive into the Agile process from the

      through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from ideation to
      delivery.
